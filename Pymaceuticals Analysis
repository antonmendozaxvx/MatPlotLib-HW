1. Capomulin and Ramicane were definitely the most effective at reducing the size of the mouse tumors and it would be interesting to
see if they could completely eliminate the tumors if given more time

2. the number of male and female mice was evenly distributed, giving for more fair valid results

3. The positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor size could lead to further studies that control the mice weight and determining
if that is a significant factor in reducing tumor size
